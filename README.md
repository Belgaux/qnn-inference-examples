# qnn-inference-examples
Jupyter notebook examples on image classification with quantized neural networks. The intent here is to give a better understanding of what kind of computations takes place when performing inference with a quantized neural network.

So far, the following notebooks are available:

1. [Basics](https://github.com/maltanar/qnn-inference-examples/blob/master/0-basics.ipynb) for a gentle warmup
2. [Binarized, fully-connected MNIST](https://github.com/maltanar/qnn-inference-examples/blob/master/1-fully-connected-binarized-mnist.ipynb) for a deep dive inside a binarized fully-connected network
3. [Binary weights, 2-bit activations, fully-connected MNIST](https://github.com/maltanar/qnn-inference-examples/blob/master/2-fully-connected-w1a2-mnist.ipynb) for demonstrating what happens when we go to 2-bit activations
