# qnn-inference-examples
Jupyter notebook examples on image classification with quantized neural networks.

So far, the following notebooks are available:

* 0-basics.ipynb for a gentle warmup
* 1-fully-connected-binarized-mnist.ipynb for a deep dive inside a binarized fully-connected network
* 2-fully-connected-w1a2-mnist.ipynb for demonstrating what happens when we go to 2-bit activations
